## Srineet Portfolio

Source code for my personal website. Visit it at [https://srineet665.github.io/Srineet.github.io/](https://srineet665.github.io/Srineet.github.io/).

### Development

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build assets: `npm run build`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

The site is built with TypeScript and Sass, and compiled files are output to the `dist` directory.
